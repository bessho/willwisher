Will Wisher. We’re reinventing the experience of drafting a will for digital-first Californians—young, tech-savvy, and asset-diverse and the Blockchain communities.

# Problem
75% of Californians under 45 don’t have a will. Younger Californians and retiring baby boomers in the middle class have no will. Self-help books and online templates are outdated and not customized. In 2025, the hourly rate of an attorney is about $500 for an Associate attorney and $1,500 for a Senior attorney. Preparing and updating a will becomes expensive.

# Soultion
