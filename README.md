Will Wisher. We’re reinventing the experience of drafting a will for digital-first Californians—young, tech-savvy, and asset-diverse and the Blockchain communities.

### Problem
75% of Californians under 45 don’t have a will. Younger Californians and retiring baby boomers in the middle class have no will. Self-help books and online templates are outdated and not customized. In 2025, the hourly rate of an attorney is about $500 for an Associate attorney and $1,500 for a Senior attorney. Preparing and updating a will becomes expensive.

### Solution
Create a digital will in under 15 minutes any time. Unlimited editing, unlimited updates, and unlimited drafts.

### Market
$5B+ California estate planning market. 15M Californians aged 25–45 desire a digital will.
Our beachhead market is California’s $5 billion estate planning sector. But we’re laser-focused on the 15 million digital natives here who need a smarter, faster, and modern way to draft the will.

### Technical Notes
It takes at least four intensive full days to force Caffeine AI to build a valid and proper legal document. To enforce AI not to deviate from the original will template is like chasing a wild horse. AI refuses to follow my clear and express instructions to use my legal language. AI rearranges my article sections and paragraphs. AI skips some paragraphs or summarizes without my consent. I have spent 3 weeks rewriting the will templates at least 5 times in order to prevent AI from deviating from the original legal language. It takes me a few dozen prompts to ask, beg, and force AI to follow 100% word by word. I’m reaching the limits of Vibe Coding. Caffeine AI must evolve into Context Engineering, where I apply system instructions, relevant documentation, and project patterns to a challenging legal tech app. It is easy to build prototypes, but it is extremely difficult to build a legally structured data-intensive app at the production level. Currently, AI-driven prototypes are not 100% repeatable via Vibe coding.
