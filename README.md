Will Wisher. We’re reinventing the experience of drafting a will for digital-first Californians—young, tech-savvy, and asset-diverse and the Blockchain communities.

### Problem
75% of Californians under 45 don’t have a will. Younger Californians and retiring baby boomers in the middle class have no will. Self-help books and online templates are outdated and not customized. In 2025, the hourly rate of an attorney is about $500 for an Associate attorney and $1,500 for a Senior attorney. Preparing and updating a will becomes expensive.

### Solution
Create a digital will in under 15 minutes any time. Unlimited editing, unlimited updates, and unlimited drafts.

### Market
$5B+ California estate planning market. 15M Californians aged 25–45 desire a digital will.
Our beachhead market is California’s $5 billion estate planning sector. But we’re laser-focused on the 15 million digital natives here who need a smarter, faster, and modern way to draft the will.

### Technical Notes
It takes at least three intensive full days to force Caffeine AI to build a legal document that is legally strict on the language and wordings, put sections and paragraphs in a strict order and sequence. To enforce AI not to deviate from the original will template is like chasing a wild horse. I have spent 3 weeks rewriting the will templates at least 5 times in order to prevent AI from deviating from the original legal language. It takes me few dozens of prompts to ask, beg, and force AI to follow 100% word by word. I’m reaching the limits of Vibe Coding. It’s important that Caffeine AI will evolve to Context Engineering, where I apply system instructions, relevant doc, and project patterns on challenging legal tech app. It is easy to build prototypes, but it is extremely difficult to build a legally structured data-intensive app at the production level. Currently, AI driven prototypes are not 100% repeatable via Vibe coding.
